# collaborative-notes

Hey everyone! This is my first ever solo project! Today, I will be making a collaborative notes app using Next.js and Firebase Firestore. It'll be similar to something like Google Docs (that's basically what this is lol, but I plan on adding some other features too and extending the functionality of the app once the basic note-taking feature is done). As always, all media used in this project that is not my own will be linked below, make sure to show the creators some love! With that said, thank you for viewing this repo and I hope you liked the project!
